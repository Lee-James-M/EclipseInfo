You are entitled to know what personal data we are processing about you. 
You have the right to request access to your personal data and you can request that we provide a copy of such data to you.  
You are entitled to have incorrect personal data regarding you corrected, and in some cases, you may request that we delete your personal data. 
You also have the right to object to certain processing of your personal data, and request that the processing of your personal data be limited. Limitation or deletion of your personal data may result in Eclipse not being able to fulfil its commitments to you. 
You also have the right to request data portability, where your personal data would be extracted in a machine-readable format and transferred to another controller. Hexagon Manufacturing Intelligence may not always be obliged to comply with a request from you for deletion, restriction, objection or data portability. Additional circumstances such as exercising the right of freedom of expression and information, compliance with a legal obligation which requires processing for establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims can justify further processing by Eclipse.  Eclipse will assess the eligibility of your request and inform you about Eclipse’s decision and reasoning.  Where you have given us your consent to process your personal data, you can withdraw your consent at any time and without justification. Where you withdraw your consent, certain personal data (only to the extent that it is absolutely required), will be retained on our “do not contact” list.

You may exercise your right to delete your account and associated data by:
